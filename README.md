# CarbonEmmisions
This project focuses on investigating which industries contribute the most to global product emissions, which account for over 75% of total global emissions. 

Using publicly available data from nature.com, which contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) measured in CO2 equivalents, the project involves analysing this information stored in a PostgreSQL database. The data covers various products, industries, and production stages. The task is to utilise SQL skills to examine this dataset and determine which industries are the largest contributors to emissions based on their carbon footprints.
